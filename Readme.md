# Twilio Messaging Example on the ESP8266 (C++, Arduino IDE)

An example application that demonstrates how to send SMS or MMS messages with an ESP8266 connected to a friendly WiFi network.

Please read [our full article]() for more information.

## Build example:

In Arduino IDE, first ensure your ESP8266 is burned with the Arduino bootloader and connected.  Then, merely adjust the globals at the top of the .ino file and hit the 'Upload' button.

## Run example:

Will run automatically once uploaded to the board.  If you do not get a message, enable serial debugging.

## Motivations

Hopefully you can incorporate this in your IoT projects with the ESP8266!
